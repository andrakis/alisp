This is the sample Lisp files location. More information about each sample is contained below.

* [seval.lisp](https://github.com/andrakis/alisp/blob/master/lisp/seval.lisp) is a Lisp evaluator, written in Lisp. It can run itself, so you can lisp whilst you lisp.

* [fac.lisp](https://github.com/andrakis/alisp/blob/master/lisp/fac.lisp) is a classic factorial example, using tail recursion. Optionally takes number to calculate from command line.

* [macros.lisp](https://github.com/andrakis/alisp/blob/master/lisp/macros.lisp) contains demonstrations of some basic useful macros.
